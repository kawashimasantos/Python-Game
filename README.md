Python dungeon game - Zombie Game

Game Title: Haunted
Game Description: ​First of all, to explain the description of this game I have to explain
how I chose the idea of the game, then it’ll be easier to understand how the game
works. My first Idea of game was to make a pacman game, but it’s difficult to think about
different features to make the game unique. Then, I had a second idea, battle game,
such as space aliens, street fight, fantasy fighter, etc. However, I fell in the same case,
difficulty to find new features. Therefore, I decide to combine these games and make a
different game. So, this game will be like pacman, where the main character can walk
just in specific places of the screen, but instead of eat the little balls and avoid the
ghosts, the main character will have a gun, and his goals is to kill as much ghosts he
can, trying to clean the path, so then he can walk and escape from the ghosts. Also, to
complete the phase and advance the level, the main character has to save the princess,
she will be located in the somewhere of the frame, surrounded by ghosts.

# Game Objects:
**1. Main Character**

a. Can walk through the path

b. Cannot go through the walls

c. Can use a gun to shoot


d. Has 5 lives


e. His goals is to escape from the ghosts and save the princess


**2. Villain / evil**


a. Can walk through the path 

b . Cannot go through the walls

c. Each one has just one 1 life


d. Their goals is to walk through the path in attempt to catch the main
character


**3. Princess**


a. She just stays in a specific place of the frame


b. She has no action


c. She has just 1 life, and if the main character fail in save her, she will die
then.


# Environment

Basically, the game will be in a kind of arena, or in better words, in a dungeon. This
place will be poor in vibrant colors, trying to pass for the user as a haunted place or
danger place, in other words, a scary mood.


# Heartbeat
So, as I said before, the game is gonna try to pass a scary mood, where you have to
have attention and concentration, to try to don’t be killed by the ghosts, and at the same
time, trying to save the princess. Thus, basically on this mood, the perfect “heartbeat”
for this project would be: “ Try to stay alive ”


# Effects
The main effects on this game will be the sounds. Since this game has a scary mood,
it’s very important to have a scary background song. This way, the game will catch the
attention of the user. Also, there’s sounds effects for when the main character use the
gun to shoot the villain. Further, there are effects for when the main character: kill a
ghost, get catch by a ghost, and when he win the game, catching the princess.


# Score
As I mentioned before, the game will be divided in differents levels, and to pass the
level, the main character has to save the princess, however, that’s not all. The game will
save the best 10 scores and their respective users, so it means that the game will save
your score in each level. So, even though the main point of the game is to save the
princess, you can also get extra points to kill the villains. For example, at the end you
could had gone until level 3 and had more scores than who went until level 4, because
you “played” more the game.
